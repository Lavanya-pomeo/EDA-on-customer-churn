# Telecom customer churn prediction

### Customer Churn:
Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company or cease their subscription to a service. It's a critical metric for businesses, especially those with subscription-based models, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
